Reviews / Comments:

One review: > “The two weeks I spent in Goa under the care of Ayurclinic Goa … were the most relaxing weeks I have ever spent.” 
Tripadvisor

Another: > “Dr. Rohit's clinic is one of the best value places in town for a medicine based relaxing and rejuvenating Ayurveda … If you are also looking for a therapeutic 7 days Panchakarma package … this is the best place to go ahead.”

Why it stands out: Good reputation for genuine Ayurvedic therapy rather than spa-only; doctors involved; multi-location (Arpora + Mandrem).

Limitations / things to check: While reviews are strong, some users in Goa warn about spa centres that look genuine but are not properly authentic.

 So for referral listing, you may want to verify credentials (doctor licence, therapy packages) directly.
